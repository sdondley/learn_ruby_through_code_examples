This is a project I'm using to teach myself Ruby. In this project, each `*.rb` file is a short lesson. Lessons are organized into topics which are organized by folders. Open a folder to see the lessons. Make sure each file is set to be executable on your machine so you can simply type `./<file_name>.rb` to run the file from the command line. Comments are contained in the lesson to help explain what the code is doing.
